# Statistical Rethinking with Python and PyMC3

This is my attempt to convert [Richard McElraeth's](https://github.com/rmcelreath) excellent book [Statistical Rethinking](https://xcelab.net/rm/) from R to Python as started by [pymc-devs](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc-resources/tree/main/Rethinking).

I did my best to preserve the exact colo schemes as well as notation structure as the book so it's easy to follow along.

Additionally, I've added a LaTex version of the end of chapter question and answers as a separate notebook with answers and explanations.

I've also included my annotated version of the (currently quite outdated) PDF from 2019.

## On Going Projects

- As of last update I'm only through Chapter 7. More to come.
- Currently no version of QUAP so we jump into MCMC a bit early.

## Installing the dependencies

To install the dependencies to run these notebooks, I recommend creating a virtual environment.

    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate

Then, install the required packages using `pip`:

    pip install -r requirements.txt"
